I wanted to start this section with "I am a ..." but got stuck there, as I could not find any word to label myself. Perhaps it is because I am a lot of things, and putting any label on would imply a person, a stereotype that, more often than not, contradicts reality. Let's start with a list of things I love to do the most: games, reading and computers. Yet, calling myself a "gamer" would not feel right, because often then people would ask me if I play CS:GO, League or any other ever-popular games, and I would have to say no. I would not qualify as a "reader" either - the number of books that I read, usually the measure of one's interest in reading, pales in comparison with others'. People also fascinate me, and on an odd day you might even catch me engaged in physical activities, like walking or playing sports. It has to be very, very odd though, for I often prefer the coziness of my room.

On the more serious note, I graduated with a Computer Science degree in 2016, and since then have worked as a Software Engineer and, simultaneously, an English teacher. When I'm working with software, they are most likely related to Artificial Intelligence - the sub-area of Computer Science that involves teaching mathematically-strong but otherwise inert computers to make good decisions. In layman's terms, that means `robots` - a myriad of robots of different kinds, some physical, the majority invisible. Teaching complements my day job and my hobbies, allowing (or should I say, forcing) me to go out and interact with people - to meet them, to get to know them and sometimes to help them make the best of themselves. Besides, it also makes use of the English I unwittingly obtained from thousands of hours playing games and an innumerable number of animal wiki pages.

I suspect many topics mentioned here will show up later, and when the time comes I could dedicate whole posts about them. For now, this would suffice.
