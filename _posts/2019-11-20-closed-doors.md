It is often said that when one door closes, another - or a thousand other, for that matter - opens. Imagine yourself, standing in a room, a hallway, whatever, whose wall is lined with an endless succession of doors. You ponder at them - some are wide open, some slightly ajar, the rest shut tight. You examine, with great interest and patience, the open rooms; you peek through the gaps; you press your ears on the closed ones, trying to make out what is on the other side. One seems most promising - leading to another corridor with music and colors and strange sights - and as you pass through the seemingly harmless door, it slams tight.

Locks out everything behind it. The thousand doors you planned on trying.

So here it is, the end of a chapter in my life - the first few years after formal education. Pushed into the world with a degree, some knowledge and a will - or a curse, if you will - to follow my inner voice and nothing else, I did what I could to survive the water. It was rough, no doubt, yet thoroughly satisfying: the pursuit of an idea, a childhood joy, to measure how far one could go and, eventually, what else should be packed on the next journey; the expedition into an unknown territory, to learn and grasp and finally master it, and to find companions there; and the discovery of a place-to-be, the people who are a joy to work with, a position in which I can both focus on my strengths and push my boundaries. For the specifics, I attempted to develop a game, tried teaching English and worked in a AI programming position. The first deserves its own chapter; the second just wrapped up recently and inconclusively; so here I would like to tell only the last story, my time at Ubitec.
