It is often said that when one door closes, another - or a thousand other, for that matter - opens. Although this is certainly true, and I, of all people, have had this fact so much ingrained that regrets and griefs plague me little, recently this metaphor came back to me from a very different perspective. Imagine yourself, standing in a room, a hallway, whatever, whose wall is lined with an endless succession of doors.

So here it is, the end of a chapter in my life - the first few years after formal education. Thrown into the world with a degree, some knowledge and a will - or a curse, if you will - to follow my inner voice and nothing else, I survived the water. It was rough, no doubt, yet thoroughly satisfying: the pursuit of an idea, a childhood joy, to measure how far one could go and, eventually, what else should be packed to reach the destination on the next journey; the expedition into an unknown territory, to learn and grasp and finally master it, and to find companions there; and the discovery of a place-to-be, the people who are a joy to work with, a position in which I can both focus on my strengths and push my boundaries.
