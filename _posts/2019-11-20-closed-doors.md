On both sides of the hallway, the wall is lined with an endless succession of doors. Some of the doors are wide open, some slightly ajar, the rest shut tight. She examines, with great patience, the open rooms; she peeks through the gaps; she presses her ears on the closed ones, trying to make out what is on the other side. One looks most promising - leading to another corridor with music and colors and strange sights - and as she passes through the seemingly harmless door, she hears a loud slam behind her.

So here it is, the end of a chapter in my life - the first few years after formal education, pushed into the world with a degree, some knowledge and a will. The water was rough, no doubt, yet the experience thoroughly satisfying: the pursuit of an idea, a childhood joy, to measure how far one could go and, eventually, what else should be packed on the next journey; the expedition into an unknown territory, to learn and grasp and finally master it, and to find companions there; and the discovery of a place-to-be, the people who are a joy to work with, and where I can both focus on my strengths and push my boundaries. The first story deserves its own post; the second wrapped up inconclusively and might resume sometime down the line; and the last will always stay in my fondest memories - I sincerely hope I would find myself in such a place again, with such people again: people from whom I learned more than from many lectures and books, and people with whom I can speak my mind frankly.
