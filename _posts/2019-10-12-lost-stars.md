"... youth is wasted on the young.  
It's hunting season, and this lamb is on the run  
searching for meaning."

Youth. Often when one think of it, a lot would come to mind. Spring, energy, innocence, creativity, passion. Being young is, most of the time, desirable. The farther it drifts from us, the harder it is to avoid the yearning, no matter the exact forms - to wind back the time and relive a life that is dearly missed; to shrug off burdens and be children once more, free to roam, free to slip; or, conversely, to return to certain places, certain intersections - the tormenting kind - and take another turn instead - see where it would have lead to.

Back in his days, he was everything. He read volumes and volumes of books - literature, historical, scientific, you name it. He wrote some screenplays, dabbed in directing, and had many admirers. He fought in a war, and got the scars to prove it and the stories to tell. And the stories were told, indeed, vividly, charmingly, as he brought characters to life and captured his audience with every word, in a manner not so different from that of a magician. Well built, well trained, he enjoyed sport competitions, winning some of them. Once an editor-in-chief of a magazine, he was respected - his words commanded authority, his approval brought joy. Yet, like all things that come and go, his prime could only last so long. And never long enough.

Seasons have come and gone since then. As if all is lost, though nothing was taken away from him - still the knowledge, the trophies, the stories he remembers and speaks of. It is also all he now speaks of - a glimmer of the past he once knew.

She was fine. Not the kind that turns heads, but fine nonetheless. If all female faces were to be blended together, and from the mix one sculpts anew, hers would be the product. In her, one felt a strange familiarity, yet if pushed to recognize the specifics would be struck wordless, for he could find none. With half a dozen siblings, her childhood was far from easy, and sometimes sacrifices had to be made for one at the cost of others. College was one of them, and straight to work she went. Books and academic things alike held little value to a pragmatic woman like her, and with sharp perception and quick wit she steered through whatever obscured and impeded her life. 

Meanwhile, years have passed without her knowing, and she has come far - some battles were won, some were lost, and some are still being fought. Once in a while, she would ponder her past decisions, wondering if she made the right calls. Though, to reminisce is a luxury she often cannot afford.

Despite being somewhat of an introvert, I happen to talk to people quite often. Some of those occasions are simply me forcing myself out, to learn and master something I was not born with. Other times, though, are due to my fascination in people. How can you not be? At particle level, we are all made up of atoms. Atoms that bond with each other, atoms that move in all sorts of patterns and atoms that, in the rare cases, transform - in turn, they give rise to energy and processes and eventually, life itself. Hence, at that level, we-are-very-similar. And yet, from some differently-placed molecules and patterns, we emerge distinct from each other, with wildly unique thoughts and feelings.

Anyway, back to the topic, I could not help but notice how people change as they age. For example, if you ask a kid what she wants to do when she grows up, more often than not the answer involves a long list of wishes, each with its own reasons and appeals. But then, as the kid becomes a teenager and then an adult, the list tends to shrink. Eventually, the answer will simply be something along the lines of "be promoted", "get more sleep" or "earn lots of money", with little further elaboration, as if they are universally, undoubtedly desirable. Isn't it sad? Likewise, back when I was tasked with recruiting for my company, a young candidate usually has grand plans and dreams for their future. Admittedly, sometimes the dreams are too grand they skirt "impossible" territory, but that's not for me to decide, and at least they do think about it. Ones that have been in the workforce for a while, though, are on average less optimistic. More importantly, the topics of interest, hobby and passion scarcely remain on their mind. Although this is not always the case, the strong prevalence begs the question: does working really dull our mind, gradually, and make us less ambitious and unique in terms of wants and feels? If not, is it maturity then?

I pray I do not stop loving what I love, and wanting to do what I want to do. It is perhaps impossible to avoid change, and yet as I learn more about the world, I pray my to-do-list will always grow in size. Not shrinking slowly and steadily towards one or a few items or, worse, none at all.

While we're on the topic of people and growing up, a few days ago I was interviewing this guy who seemingly had a lot of experience and knowledge building chatbots, and who a colleague recommended to the company. However, as I was explaining to him the programming question which makes up the first stage of our assessment process, it was clear he was not prepared for it. Despite playing it tough, his voice was trembling and his hands were shaking visibly. "What? Me, having to do programming to join? Are you serious? I know the CEO here!", thought he while texting his friend asking if it was a joke and that he was gonna leave. Anxiety and disatisfaction, at once.

I am sure he will eventually find a job elsewhere, a company that does not check a candidate's programming skills for a programming position. I was just slightly disappointed. And furious, I admit, that such attitude exists.
