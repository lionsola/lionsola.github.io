The idea of this blog happened more than one year ago. My wife and I, back when we were still dating, ate out together very regularly. During our `gastronomic` journey we came across some very good restaurants and we would come back from time to time and use as benchmarks to "rate" other places. We also had quite a few not-so-good memories, and likewise those are set in stone as examples of places-we-should-never-return to. However, one thing was similar about both kinds of experience - for days we would talk about them, crack inside jokes and rehearse our glorious expeditions to our friends. One day, after a particularly, hilariously bad meal, a thought just came to us: let's start a blog together, so we can write down stories like these, re-read them after some time and even share them with our friends. My then-girlfriend enjoyed writing and had written some short stories before, especially in school, and I had always had things I would like to put down but never found the right time nor the right place to. Why not?

From conception, it took more than a year for the idea to materialize, and truth be told I am still uncertain of its direction. I guess it will be a place for us to share whatever we like to share. In addition to the original topic of food adventures, I could also write about other things - like books and games that I enjoyed. I can write about work, too. The problems that I solve. The people that I meet. The students that I taught. Oh, the possibilities ... I hope I find the time to write about them all.

This will probably be the only post here for a time, while I try to get the site up and running - pardon me, it's my first foray into the world of web development, and I am still learning day by day. Actually, I might also blog about the creation of the site itself from a technical point of view. Might make a good read for someone.
